# write_your_dynamic_language_runtime

This repository is used for the course "How to implement a dynamic language on the JVM" at University Gustave Eiffel (Paris France)

This repository provide the basis to implement your own
- Abstract Syntax Tree Interpreter
- Stack based Interpreter
- Java Virtual Machine based Interpreter

of a dynamically typed language named [smalljs](smalljs.md) which is almost a subset of JavaScript.

How to compile and create a jar
---
run Maven with a Java 15
```
  mvn package
```
a jar named smalljs-1.0.jar in the folder `target` is generated

How to run it
---
Still with Java 15
```
  java --enable-preview --class-path lib/tatoo-runtime.jar:target/smalljs-1.0.jar fr.umlv.smalljs.main.Main ast samples/hello.js
  java --enable-preview --class-path lib/tatoo-runtime.jar:target/smalljs-1.0.jar fr.umlv.smalljs.main.Main stack samples/hello.js
  java --enable-preview --class-path lib/tatoo-runtime.jar:target/smalljs-1.0.jar fr.umlv.smalljs.main.Main jvm samples/hello.js
```
with 'ast' being the AST interpreter, 'stack' being the Stack based interpreter and 'jvm' being the JVM based interpreter.
